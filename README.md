When building this library management system, several key decisions were made to ensure the program is both functional and easy to use. By focusing on these design choices, I aimed to create a library management system that’s easy to use, maintain, and extend in the future. Whether you’re managing a small personal library or a larger collection, this system should help keep everything organized and accessible
